			<P>One morning, when <EM>Gregor Samsa</EM> woke from troubled dreams, he found himself transformed in his bed into a <STRONG>horrible vermin</STRONG>. 
			He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. </P>
			<P>The bedding was hardly able to <SPAN class="onderlijn">cover it</SPAN> and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, waved about helplessly as he looked. 
			<EM><Q>What's happened to me?</Q></EM> he thought. It wasn't a dream.</P>
